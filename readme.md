# Disclaimer: not an actual project

I'm trying random things in Rust, this happens to be one of them.
Despite being called "video reducer", almost any video would largely increase in size so don't use it.
Also, "reducer" isn't the right word, but who cares?

Notes:
- A full frame includes every pixel
- A partial frame includes some pixels only. The previous frame(s) must be used to recreate a partial frame
